# giffyChallenge

Ideally for production a lot needs to still be done. I have detailed a lot of the requirements that need to be met for production in TODO comments, however due to the CORS friendly nature of the app requirements, for this prototype, installing is as simple as downloading the index.html and opening it via file protocol.

Please take a look at the commit history as I have tried to leave comments as to my logic whilst building the project, aweareness of issues that were outside of the scope of the challenge, as well as a few questions.
